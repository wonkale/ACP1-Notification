 - user interface what Jaakko proposed
	- draw widgets to screen
	- add application menu and connect it to the UI
	- add help class and connect it to the UI

 - notification delaying
	1. trivial catch all and delay for x minutes
	2. connect UI time and on/off to delayer
	3. connect the application menu to the delayer, and match notifications to them

 - help content
	- simple "hello world" like tutorial

 - desktop shortcut buttons
	- instant delay all on/off
	- instant relase are queued notifications
